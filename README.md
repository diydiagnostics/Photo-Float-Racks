## colorimetric-LAMP-Float-Racks

## Welcome to the  [DIY Diagnostics](https://diystream.cns.utexas.edu/ "DIY Diagnostics")  [Freshman Research Initiative](https://cns.utexas.edu/fri "Freshman Research Initiative") repository for improved water bath floats.

This repository was created by Niam Kuttanna, Andrew Kan, and Haroon Dossani under the supervision of Dr. Timothy Riedel. It represents an archive of various designs for 3D printed float racks.

## Purpose
Water bath floats are often not optimized for taking photographs of the reaction tubes during incubation. Often the process of inspecting assays comprises three steps: removing the water bath lid; detaching assay tubes from floating sponges; and holding up tube strips for visual inspection or photography. This yields inconsistent images, wastes valuable time, and introduces a host of factors that can affect the certainty of future results (i.e. temperature variation from leaving the water bath open while removing and replacing reaction tubes).

The combination 0.2 ml tube rack/floats described below simplify the process of running and imaging reactions. They are easily printed with a consumer grade 3D printer and the design files are downloadable from this repository. The racks provides for straightforward solution pipetting and ensures a secure hold on the standard 8-tube strip. The tube rack floats so the reactions and rack can be dropped in a water bath directly without the need to transfer the tubes to a float.

These racks are designed for easy assay inspection. The rack designs include a solid color background that enables the entire rack (with tubes) to be lifted out of the water bath and photographed directly. There is no need to transfer the tubes to another holder. 

In addition we have designed a "photo booth" hood that the rack can sit directly on to provide consistent background lighting and focal distance from a smartphone. 

## Case-Study
The [DIY Diagnostics](https://diystream.cns.utexas.edu/ "DIY Diagnostics") lab heavily utilizes the NEB 
[Colorimetric LAMP 2X Master Mix](https://www.neb.com/products/m1800-warmstart-colorimetric-lamp-2x-master-mix-dna-rna#Product%20Information "Colorimetric LAMP 2X Master Mix") to develop sequence specific diagnostic tests. During development we take many photographs over timepoints and the racks described in this repository have enabled more accurate documentation of the diagnotic performance.

## 3D Printing Guide
To print one of these designs, follow the steps below.
1. Download the STL file to a laptop or desktop computer.
2. Load the STL file in a 3D printing software, such as Ultimaker Cura or Craftware.
3. Slice the STL file and convert it to a GCODE file.
4. Load the GCODE file onto an appropriate device for connecting to the printer, navigate to the necessary print startup menu, and start the print. Ensure sufficient filament is available.
- For an Ultimaker 2.0 printer: export the GCODE file to an SD card and insert the SD card into the printer. Select the "Print" option, locate the respective file, and start the print.
- For a Craftbot printer: a) copy the GCODE file onto a USB and insert the USB into the printer; b) connect to the printer over Wifi and start the print directly from Craftware; or c) connect to the printer using a USB A-B cable and start the print directly from Craftware.
