This folder contains the STL files for all tube rack imaging system variants.

Current imaging system designs are built to accommodate any 8 capacity or 16 capacity tube rack, with 9 capacity rack compatibility planned for future installments. The IS Horizontal variant is best suited for Android smartphones, while the IS Vertical variants are optimized for iPhones but is also compatible with some Android smartphones (including the Galaxy S9).

We recommend the IS Vertical 2.0 variant for its wider array of compatible smartphones, improved spacer system, and universal tube rack handle functionality.

To use any of these designs:
- Simply place a compatible tube rack on one of the two holder rails (either the angled rails or the rear flat rail).
- Next, slot a compatible smartphone - horizontally or vertically depending on the variant - into the camera holder. Additional spacers are available for precise smartphone positioning. The smartphone camera should be aligned with the camera holder aperture on the inside face of the imaging system.
- Focus the camera on the tube rack as necessary, and take a photograph. Be sure to always set up the system under the same conditions, especially with regards to lighting, to guarantee consistent photographs across all imaging sessions.
