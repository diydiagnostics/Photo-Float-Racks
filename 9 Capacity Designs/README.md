This folder contains the STL files for all 9 capacity tube rack variants.

9 capacity tube racks are built to hold three triplicate assays. Retaining most of the benefits of their 8 capacity predecessors, the 9 capacity tube racks sacrifice a larger size for increased convenience. While running triplicate assays using the standard 8-tube strip results in two wasted tubes, 9 capacity tube racks make this a non-issue.

As of July 25th, 2019, the only 9 capacity tube rack design is the 9C Original. This design is ideal for scientists who are accustomed to threefold reaction sets and are looking to minimize wasted equipment.
