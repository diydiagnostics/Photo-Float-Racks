This folder contains the STL files for all 16 capacity tube rack variants.

16 capacity tube racks are built to hold two 8-tube strips with only a minimal increase in bulk. Each variant features a backdrop for imaging, reduced structural mass for optimized size, and a clip design of your choice.

We recommend the 16C Dual Handle variant to start. This variant includes the option for both a clip-on handle and a peg handle, making it the best choice if you are unsure which handle you prefer.
