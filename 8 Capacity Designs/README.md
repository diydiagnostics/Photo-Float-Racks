This folder contains the STL files for all 8 capacity tube rack variants.

8 capacity tube racks are built to hold a single 8-tube strip. Light and versatile, these designs allow for a variety of different features. Some designs also include handle compatibility; these handles require high precision printing to fully function.

We recommend the 8C Backdrop and 8C Light designs to start. These former is best suited for imaging, while the minimalistic design of the latter requires the least amount of material and time to print.
